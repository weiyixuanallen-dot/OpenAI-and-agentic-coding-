I'm going to show you how to install Claude Code. You can find the complete process on Claude's official quickstart page: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart
You'll need to run a command specific to your environment. For example, since I'm on a Mac, I'd use the brew command. However, I already have it installed, so I'll skip that step.
Once Claude Code is installed, you can access it using the claude command. After entering the command, you'll be prompted to select your preferred style. Then, you'll choose whether to use the Claude Code API or a Claude account with a subscription. I have a Pro subscription, so I'll go with the first option.
Next, your default browser will open, and you'll log in with your account. Once successfully logged in, you'll be able to chat with Claude directly in your terminal.
In the command line, simply tell the AI that you want to play the Tetris game — for example, you can type something like “Run the Tetris game” or “I want to play Tetris.”
The AI will execute the full game code right inside PowerShell.
In just a few seconds, a new window will pop up, and the Tetris game will start running.
What’s even better is that you can also ask the AI to update or add new features — like changing game colors, speed, or difficulty — and AI inside PowerShell will modify the game for you.
its not just Tetris, nowadays AI can actually make more games or even pictures or videos you want.
