## Topic summary:

### Our mission is to use the installed AI within the computerâ€™s PowerShell or terminal environment to create a Tetris game. At each step, the AI will ask the user whether the code is acceptable or if more features are needed. Finally, the user will be able to launch the AI-built game directly from PowerShell to play with.
